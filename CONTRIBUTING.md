## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- **Always use TypeScript** for new files
- **Strict typing** - avoid `any` types
- **Interface definitions** for component props and API responses
- **Type guards** for external data validation

### React Components

- **Functional components** with hooks
- **PascalCase** for component names
- **camelCase** for props and variables
- **Meaningful component names** that describe purpose

### File Structure

```
app/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player/          # Player-related components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visualization/   # Visual components (vinyl, album art)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/          # Media information display
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/         # Layout and structure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Reusable UI components
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `VinylRecord.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: `camelCase` starting with `use` (e.g., `usePlayerState`)
- **Utilities**: `camelCase` (e.g., `formatDuration`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_VOLUME`)

### Code Organization

```typescript
// 1. React imports
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// 2. Third-party imports
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

// 3. Local imports
import { usePlayerContext } from '@/contexts/PlayerContext';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';

// 4. Types
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onPlay: () => void;
}

// 5. Component
export function Component({ title, onPlay }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```
